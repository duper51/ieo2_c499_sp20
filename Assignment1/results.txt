Assignment 1:  AFL and libFuzzer
DUE DATE:  2/17/20

1.  Create a private github repo, named <yournauid>_cs499_sp20

2.  Give me access as a collaborator (I'm agroce@gmail.com)

3.  Find some interesting C function out there in the real world.  
Put a brief description of what it does, and where you got it.  You want this to be fairly simple and reasonable to fuzz.

4.  Put that code as a function in a file cfunction.c, with header cfunction.h.  See afl_example/pbuffer.c/.h for some guidance on what this will look like.

5.  Write an AFL "harness" for your function, put it in afl_cfunction.c.

6.  Write a libFuzzer "harness" for your function, put it in libfuzzer_cfunction.cpp.

7.  Write an appropriate Makefile.

8.  RUN THESE FUZZERS, with AFL with and without -d, with some interesting different seeds, and with libFuzzer with different size limits and -use_value_profile=1.

9.  Discuss your results in a file, results.txt.  You're gonna want at least 300 words here.  More is fine.
